Code of Conduct

Purpose & Scope:

Our team is committed to creating a collaborative, respectful, and inclusive environment while developing software that provides easy access to reporting on population information via an SQL database. 

This Code of Conduct defines the standards for behaviour, communication, and collaboration to ensure our project’s success and maintain a positive and professional team culture. This applies to all project activities, including but not limited to:
GitHub repositories, commits, pull requests, issues, and discussions
Team communication on Slack, email, and meetings
Development, testing, documentation, and project management tasks

By using Scrum and Kanban boards as our guiding frameworks, we will emphasise iterative development, continuous feedback, and transparent communication. Team members will actively participate in stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives, refining the backlog and keeping task boards updated. These practices ensure accountability, maintain project momentum, and deliver high-quality, reliable software as a team.

Our Pledge:

As team members, we pledge to:

* - Promote respect, inclusion, and trust in all interactions.
* - Encourage constructive feedback and continuous learning.
* - Foster collaboration and transparency in software development.
* - Maintain high-quality, reliable, and ethical software practices.

Standards of Behaviour:

Team members are expected to:

* - Communicate respectfully and professionally in all channels (GitHub, Slack, meetings, email).
* - Share knowledge, help teammates, and be open to guidance.
* - Follow the agreed Scrum/Kanban processes, attend stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives.
* - Include meaningful comments to explain complex logic or important decisions.
* - Use clear and consistent names for variables, functions, and files.
* - Write modular code where possible, avoiding duplication and improving reusability.
* - Include unit tests or integration tests where applicable, and ensure the code passes tests before submitting.
* - Keep commit messages clear and descriptive, indicating the purpose of the change.

Collaboration and Code Review:

* Code reviews will occur every two weeks, and all team members should actively participate.
* - Feedback should be specific, constructive, and solution-oriented, avoiding personal attacks.
* - Approvals require understanding and alignment with team coding standards and best practices.
* - Encourage pair programming or mentoring if necessary to improve code quality.
* - Document discussions and decisions in GitHub issues or pull request comments for transparency.
* - Being late or not being ready when the meeting starts will result in the grade for that review being capped at 40%
* - Not attending the meeting at all will result in the grade being marked at 0% for that review.

Unacceptable Behaviour:

The following behaviours will not be tolerated:

* - Harassment, discrimination, or offensive comments related to race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, age, or any personal characteristic.
* - Personal attacks, aggressive language, or public shaming.
* - Ignoring or obstructing team processes, such as Scrum/Kanban workflow or code review practices.
* - Sharing sensitive or private data irresponsibly, or deliberately sabotaging or behaving unethically in software development.


Disciplinary Procedures

We must work as a team. In cases where anyone is dismissed, they won’t be able to deliver the coursework and will fail the coursework. Dismissal from the team involves the following:

1. “An individual is evidenced as breaching the Code of Conduct as set-out by the student team.”
2. “Evidence is presented at the next available meeting with a member of the module delivery team.”
3. “The individual will have the opportunity to evidence mitigating circumstances either to the student team or privately to a member of the module delivery team.”
4. “The module delivery team retains the right to the final decision of whether the dismissal is warranted.”

Agreement

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct. Every team member is encouraged to read, understand, and actively practice these standards.
